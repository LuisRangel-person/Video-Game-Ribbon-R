Please don’t steal my code without giving me credit, I am but a humble student.

I am uploading my source code for Video Game Ribbon to GitHub so that other people can look at it. I made this software in mid 2015 in order to build a skeleton for an eventual iPhone app. This code was written in Visual C++ in Visual Studio 2015.
 
WARNING-There is a “Password” system, but it is magnificently insecure as it pulls from an unencrypted file. Don’t use any important passwords with this software.

This application uses number based menu inputs. 
You can add video games to your collection individually or as part of a lot. 
You can edit the information later if you got it wrong. 
The main features of this application were the “Ribbons” that would print out color coded lists based on certain parameters. 
The Basic Ribbon just printed out the collection with no colors.
The Investment Ribbon printed out the collection with colors based off the return value of the game based off how much you paid for it. Green=Profit, Red=Loss, Gray=Even
The Collector Ribbon printed out the collection with X’s filled out based on whether the user had the box, manual, and or inserts. The X is red if the user had the item.
The Gameplay Ribbon printed out the collection based on whether the user beat, didn’t beat, or 100% completed the game. Grey if the game was unbeatable. White if unbeaten. Magenta if Beaten. Yellow if completed.

If I had a chance to do this over, I would use SQL instead of using lots of vectors.
I hope you enjoy the code and keep an eye out for Video Game Ribbon on the App Store!
